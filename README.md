# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Functionality
1. API Endpoints: Various CRUD (Create, Read. Update, Delete) operations for interacting with clothing items and user data.

2. Data Management: Efficient data storage and retrieval with MongoDB

3. Testing: Utilizing Postman for API testing to ensure endpoint reliability

## Technologies and Techniques
1. Node.js & Express.js: The server is built using Node.js with Express.js facilitating the creation of API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.

2. MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data and clothing items.

3. Postman: A tool used for testing API endpoints to ensure they behave as expected.


## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
